Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.foo must be replaced
-/+ resource "null_resource" "foo" {
      ~ id       = "4654577444608769802" -> (known after apply)
      ~ triggers = { # forces replacement
          ~ "foo" = "bar" -> "bar2"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
